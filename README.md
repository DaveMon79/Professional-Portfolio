# Dave Monaghan - Professional Portfolio

I was given the task of creating a professional portfolio to display my work to potential employers, once I’ve completed the University of Birmingham - Coding Bootcamp. 

# Actions taken 

Using HTML & CSS, I created a professional looking portfolio for myself. The portfolio includes the following information:

* Header with navigational links
* An image of myself
* Personal bio of work history and personal statement
* Examples of previous projects I’ve completed, with links to the projects
* Footer with contact information which links to each contact form 


# Code Style

* HTML 
* CSS

# Difficulties

This project was extremely challenging. Once I’d decided on my design, I had found the following issues difficult to resolve:

* Using the display and position properties to make page look how I’d envisaged it
* Overlaying work images with a label
* Making the page tablet and mobile responsive
